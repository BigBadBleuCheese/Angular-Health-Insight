# Angular Health Insight

This project demonstrates using Angular to display the front end of a health care patient portal.
To make it possible to view in your web browser, it's been built in Angular production configuration and GitHub Pages for this repo has been configured to [make that build visible](https://bigbadbleucheese.github.io/Angular-Health-Insight/).

## Angular Concepts Demonstrated

### Components
* Standalone components with scoped styles
* Integration with Angular Material components (`mat-sidenav`, `mat-toolbar`, `mat-list`, `mat-icon`, etc.)

### Templates
* Structural directives like `*ngIf`
* Template reference variables and programmatic control of UI elements

### Directives
* Use of built-in attribute directives like `routerLink`
* Dynamic bindings to control component behavior through template syntax

### Dependency Injection
* Application-level service for session management
* Use of Angular's DI system for managing logic and state across components

### Reactive Programming
* Use of RxJS observables for reactive service communication and UI updates
* Subscription-based pattern for responding to asynchronous events and data changes

### Routing
* Centralized route configuration with route-driven navigation
* Separation of feature areas through component-based routing

### Forms
* Template-driven login form demonstrating input handling and validation
